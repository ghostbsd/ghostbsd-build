:::::::::::::::::::::About This Theme:::::::::::::::::::::

Vibrancy Colors is a beautiful flattish and "vibrant" icon theme. Vibrancy is a mixture of many, Of the top open source icon themes into a new beautiful icon theme. It is meant to be modern clean and customizable. It was built with RAVEfinity Color GTK Themes in mind or any theme you see fit. And is meant to work nicely with flat gtk themes.

Vibrancy Flat features Vivid and beautiful application icons (A very slightly tweaked version of the Moka Icon Theme) 13 Different Folder Colors Selectable Based on KDE 5's Breeze Folders. Along with support for 5 types of monochrome panels & Tool-bar configurations Based on Faenza & elementary. 2 Non monochrome tool-bars configurations are selectable as "NonMono" Panel stays Monochrome on both however.

13 Colors of Folders are Selectable: Stock Manila Folders ,Blue , Aqua , Graphite , Blue Vivid (Dark), Brown, Green , Purple, Red , Pink, Orange, Teal, Yellow. 


5 Versions are Selectable:
Just play with it if you don't understand what this means, be sure to open gedit or something with a toolbar so you know what is what.

Vibrancy Light - Dark Monochrome Panel Icons For Light Panels. And Dark Monochrome Icons For Toolbar Icons
Vibrancy Dark - Light Monochrome Panel Icons for Dark Panels. And Dark Monochrome Icons For Toolbars Icons.
Vibrancy Full Dark - Light Monochrome Panel Icons for Dark Panels. And Light Monochrome Icons For Toolbars Icons.

Vibrancy-NonMono-Dark- Keeps the Light Monochrome panel icons for a Dark panel theme. but then provides traditional toolbar icons (Color based)
Vibrancy-NonMono-Light- Keeps the Dark Monochrome panel icons for a Light panel theme. but then provides traditional toolbar icons (Color based)


Vibrancy Colors should work on any GTK Desktop On Any distro. but it has not been tested on ones released before then 2014. We did some complex linking and inheriting to make the theme slim and as few files as possible (We got it down from 121,000 files to about 43,000) this may cause issues on some older desktops but most likely not. 

Update 1.1: Fixes DOCX Mimetype Icons, Adds Apple(TM) DMG Disk Image Icon, RedShift Mono Icon for dark theme. 

We ARE NOT trying to take much credit for this icon theme as we feel it would be disrespectful to the authors whos work it uses. However please note we did spend alot of time putting it together (Think of us like a linux distro, compiling lots of things and making sure it works and looks good) We did some design, testing, tweaking and fixing issues. Engineering a icon theme like this is not simple as it would seem. It's very complex with all the colors and versions. But the authors of the other icon themes used in this most likely did way more work as they created things from scratch. 

PLEASE SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS:
THIS THEME IS MADE UP OF OTHERS AMAZING OPEN SOURCE HARD WORK:

Do Not credit us for everything, This theme is made up of others beautiful hard work, please support the authors. 
We do not want to hurt anyones endeavors or the community. This is NOT a FORK of anything whatsoever. 
It's just a fusion of some really awesome themes into another awesome theme (We Hope).

Application Icons, Majority Of Icons used in Theme.

Are a slightly modified version of The Faba & Moka Icon Theme

:::::::::::::::::::::ABOUT THEMES :::::::::::::::::::::


Most GTK 2 & 3 themes  or Icon Themes for Linux (BSD etc) are distributed in a tar.gz or zip format. by default. (Or more specifically  Source)

Some themes are available in .deb packages or rpm etc.. See our website to download them! If you get one in those formats you can safely install it (By double clicking on it) avoiding the need for manual installation discussed here.

This guide covers manually installing themes from SOURCE or tar.gz files! despite the "Scary name" there is no compiling or difficult things needed to a install a theme this way. Believe it or not the only thing you have to do is copy the theme files into the proper folder and your desktop should automatically recognize them!

Heres how we do that...
Thats being said just install and activate it on your desktop as shown bellow...

(!) Always back up your data and use these instructions at own risk! its not ours nor our contributors fault if anything goes wrong.
